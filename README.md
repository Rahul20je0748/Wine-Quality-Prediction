## Project Overview

In this project, our goal is to build a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict the quality of wines based on various physicochemical attributes and sensory characteristics. The dataset used for this endeavor contains information about both red and white wines, encompassing attributes such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid content, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol content, and, most importantly, the quality rating assigned by human tasters.

## Dataset

The dataset employed for this project is the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009?resource=download) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. This dataset comprises 1599 instances of wine samples  each annotated with 12 input features and a corresponding quality score..

To acquire the dataset, follow these steps:

1. Visit the [Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009?resource=download) webpage.
2. Download the dataset (CSV format) from the provided link.
3. Unzip the downloaded file.
4. Place the extracted CSV files (`winequalityprediction.csv`) into the "data" directory located at the root of this project.

## Installation

Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wine-quality-prediction.git
```
cd wine-quality-prediction
Set up a virtual environment (recommended):
```
python3 -m venv venv
```
Activate virtual environment
```
venv/bin/activate
```
Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage
To run the wine quality prediction script, execute the following command:
python "python predict_wine_quality.py"
This command will load the trained machine learning model and make predictions on a sample dataset.



## Model Building
Our wine quality prediction model is constructed through a sequence of well-defined steps:

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is thoroughly cleaned, missing values are addressed, and features are appropriately scaled.

Feature Selection: Relevant features are identified through correlation analysis and domain expertise.

Model Selection: Various machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Gradient Boosting, are experimented with to determine the best-performing model.

Hyperparameter Tuning: The hyperparameters of the selected model are fine-tuned to achieve optimal performance.

Training and Validation: The dataset is divided into training and validation sets, allowing us to train the model and assess its accuracy effectively.

Model Persistence: The final trained model is saved to disk for later use.
## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using a range of metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves. Visualizations like confusion matrices provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's predictive capabilities
